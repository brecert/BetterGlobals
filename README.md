# BetterGlobals

This is a Resonite mod that makes it easier to work with globals.

The mod implements the following feature requests from these issues

- https://github.com/Yellow-Dog-Man/Resonite-Issues/issues/3888
- https://github.com/Yellow-Dog-Man/Resonite-Issues/issues/3885
- https://github.com/Yellow-Dog-Man/Resonite-Issues/issues/3724
- https://github.com/Yellow-Dog-Man/Resonite-Issues/issues/3719

Currently when Globals are "Cleared" the original Global is not removed, this can create additional "dangling" globals that should be removed manually.
This behavior is unintuitive and may be changed in the future.
